== Groupize Design Interview Problem

This is a small sample page that's intended to help us understand how you approach
styling and design.

We have created a single index page from a small Ruby on Rails application that 
our admins use to keep track of the snacks in the kitchen. (We're a hungry bunch!)
The trouble is that this application is not styled at all.

Please style the index page of this application.

You should feel free to modify the page layout in any way you wish. You should
feel free to add any color elements you want. If you add color, please ensure that it
matches the Groupize logo colors: #94c04b (green) and #333433 (dark grey).

Please use Github to host the source code for your application.


== Application Setup

To set up this application, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repo on Github by clicking the "Fork" button
2. Clone your forked repo
3. Cd into the directory containig the application
4. Run the index page in whatever browser you see fit.

When you're done, let us know and we'll take a look at the fork.
